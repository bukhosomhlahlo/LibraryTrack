# 📚 Library Management System -Java

## Actors:
The actors include the following: 
* Librarian
* Checkout Clerk
* Borrower
* Administrator

## Use Cases:
After determining the actors, the second step in use case analysis is to determine the tasks that each actor will need to do with the system. Each task is called a use case because it represents one particular way the system will be used.

**In other words, only those use cases are listed that actors will need to do when they are using the system to solve the customer’s problem.**
